## How to Install/Use
TransSocial is 100% pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no NodeJS dependencies. All you have to do is:
- Get the source code\
You can either download the zip file provided by GitHub from the <a href="https://github.com/katniny/transsocial/releases/tag/Version" target="_blank">Release tabs</a> or use Git.
- Open it in the code editor of your choice\
(We recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>)
- Replace Values\
In order to get TransSocial working with your Firebase setup, get all the required components (if you're unsure how to, follow <a href="https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592#zippy=%2Cin-this-article">this guide</a> by Google. Then, navigate to the very top of /assets/js/ts_fas_acih.js and find:
```API_KEY="REPLACE"
AUTH_DOMAIN="REPLACE"
DATABASE_URL="REPLACE"
PROJECT_ID="REPLACE"
STORAGE_BUCKET="REPLACE"
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="REPLACE"
APP_ID="REPLACE"
MEASUREMENT_ID="REPLACE"
```
Then replace all "REPLACE" values with your own.
- Start the project\
Open the project somehow. I use <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server by Ritwick Dey</a> but you can use anything that works for you.\
