# What's Been Done on the Rewrite
- Pages are now .js files rather than .html, making it easier to add page-specific code without more scripts (though, you can still do this).
- SPA has been implemented
- Standard .js files have been depreciated for modular .js files (please avoid using classic .js files unless NEEDED!)
- ts_fas_acih.js has been depreciated
- / is no longer an individual page but now just goes straight to home with no additional code to run



## TODO (based on what's been completed):
- Add documentation on adding new pages
