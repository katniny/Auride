keeping track of what i did so i can make an update log later
yes, also the technical details:

## technical
- Start utilizing .env file
    - This allows us to not have to not replace our Firebase config
    each time there's a change, and prevents accidental API keys
    committing.
- Start utilizing Vite and its modular JavaScript files
    - This allows us to utilize amazing work from the JavaScript community,
    letting us made Auride better, and faster.
    - Modular JavaScript files will allow us to catch bugs faster, as modular
    JavaScript files are a lot more restrictive and verbose.
- Checking signed in/out status is quicker
    - Auride no longer waits for the entire page to load before redirecting
    if signed in/out. Auride will now await to see the users logged in status
    before doing the appropriate action, if any is necessary at all, even if
    the page isn't fully loaded yet.
- Set up the Vercel server hosting
    - Auride now takes advantage of Vercel Serverless Functions to host our APIs, to make Auride much more 
    secure, faster, and expandable. https://vercel.com/docs/functions
- JavaScript is now modularized (Related to "Start utilizing Vite and its modular JavaScript files")
    - Auride now has all its code seperated into several files, rather than having all our code in
    one huge file. This makes Auride easier to work with, but also will less likely result in several
    things breaking when one thing does, which was the previous behavior.
- Checking signed in/out status can be interrupted
    - On pages that have these scripts, they can now be interrupted if it is not necessary when a
    user first signs in. This is used on the registration page to ensure that we do not kick the
    user out of the registration process because they're signed in.

## user end
- Added reset password to the login page
    - Truly revoluntary feature, I know, but, Auride has been lacking this feature for
    a long time now. You were honestly SOL if you didn't know your password.
    Now it's not a worry! Unless you don't know your email...
- Registration now happens all on one page
    - The previous behavior was that everything would happen on seperate pages,
    which caused a page reload each time which caused registration to be slower.
- Added welcome animation
    - When you sign up for Auride, you will now get a welcome message before
    completing the onboarding process (setting your names, pronouns, etc., etc.)
