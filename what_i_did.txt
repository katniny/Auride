keeping track of what i did so i can make an update log later
yes, also the technical details:

## technical
- Start utilizing .env file
    - This allows us to not have to not replace our Firebase config
    each time there's a change, and prevents accidental API keys
    committing.
- Start utilizing Vite and its modular JavaScript files
    - This allows us to utilize amazing work from the JavaScript community,
    letting us made Auride better, and faster.
    - Modular JavaScript files will allow us to catch bugs faster, as modular
    JavaScript files are a lot more restrictive and verbose.
- Checking signed in/out status is quicker
    - Auride no longer waits for the entire page to load before redirecting
    if signed in/out. Auride will now await to see the users logged in status
    before doing the appropriate action, if any is necessary at all.

## user end
- Added reset password to the login page
    - Truly revoluntary feature, I know, but, Auride has been lacking this feature for
    a long time now. You were honestly SOL if you didn't know your password.
    Now it's not a worry! Unless you don't know your email...
