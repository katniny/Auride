            <p>One year ago today, TransSocial relaunched the goal of making a space that felt safe, kind, and real. A place for people to exist, connect, and express themselves without feeling weird or bullied for it.</p>
            <p>When relaunching TransSocial last year, I was admittedly nervous and stressed. I wasn't sure people would show up or even care. But you guys showed up, and still do, and that means the world to me. Thank you.</p>

            <br />

            <h2>🛠 What we've done in a year</h2>
            <p>I've added, changed, removed, and fixed <i>a lot</i> since TransSocial's relaunch, and it's been fun learning along the way. There's too much to cover for an entire year of work, but there are some things I'm really proud of:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
                <li><b>Still privacy-first</b>: And we always will be. TransSocial doesn't track you or sell your data. There's no ads, no creepy analytics, no algorithms trying to push stuff. Just people being themselves.</li>
                <li><b>8 default themes + custom themes</b>: Along with our default 8 themes you can choose from, you can get and make your own custom themes if we don't have one you like, or if you just feel like expressing your creativity.</li>
                <li><b>Markdown support:</b> We have support for markdown, a way to express yourself even further with <i>italics</i>, <b>bold</b>, or even <u>underlined</u> text.</li>
                <li><b>Post flags</b>: TransSocial has 3 options for flags, "Hide", "Blur" and "Show", and you can choose to hide NSFW, sensitive, or political content to curate your home page to your liking. The most customizable post flags on any social media site. I plan on expanding this very soon as well... 👀</li>
                <li><b>A safe place</b>: TransSocial is still a safe place for everyone, a place where you can express yourself without the fear of being bullied or harrassed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There's still so much more I want to add as well. DMs, groups, muted words, and so much more. But unfortunately, everything takes time, and I'm only one person.</p>

            <br />

            <h2>🔧 What's happening now</h2>
            <p style="font-size: smaller; color: var(--text-semi-transparent);">No, not the Twitter slogan.</p>
            <p>I'm working on improving the current experience for you guys, as well as on the development side. Making things cleaner, faster, and less messy under the hood.</p>
            <p>Things like improved structure, easier styling, and unified UI elements.</p>
            <p>My goal is to keep building on what's already working, while cleaning up what isn't.</p>

            <br />

            <h2>❓ What's next?</h2>
            <p>I don't wanna spoil too much, but I have a lot of plans for TransSocial. To create a unified experience, to be even more of a social site, and much, much more.</p>
            <p>But when my power is back on, I'll be working on adding 2 very requested features very soon. 👀</p>
            <p>These features being more expansive post flags and muted keywords.</p>
            <p>For everything else though, you'll just have to wait and see. ;)</p>

            <br />

            <p>As you may know, TransSocial is only in the pre-alpha stage.</p>
            <p>By the end of 2025, I hope to be in <b>Beta</b>, or even later.</p>
            <p>But of course, things take time, and we'll see where I get!</p>

            <br />
