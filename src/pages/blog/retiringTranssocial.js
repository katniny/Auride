            <p>Over the past couple years, I've been building something I deeply believe in. A safe that's kind, safe, and open. A place that welcomes you just as you are.</p>
            <p>That space was called <b>TransSocial</b>. And thanks to all of you, it grew into something real. Something loved.</p>

            <br />

            <p>But, we also heard something else:</p>
            <p>Many people saw the name and assumed it was only for trans people (85% of people I asked!). And while trans people will <i>always</i> be welcome with open arms, our mission isn't exclusive.</p>
            <b>We're building a safe place for everyone.</b>

            <br />
            <br />

            <h3>Welcome to Auride</h3>
            <b>TransSocial got us here. Auride is what's going to take us further.</b>
            <p>This isn't just a name change. It's a reflection of who we are and what we believe in:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>✨ Kindness without conditions</p>
                <p>✨ Connection without judgment</p>
                <p>✨ and a space where <i>you</i> feel at home</p>
            </ul>

            <br />

            <p>Alongside this rebrand, we're also officially moving Auride into <b>alpha</b>.</p>
            <p>That means more structure, more polish, and a whole lot more to come -- while still staying true to what makes this space special.</p>

            <br />

            <p>Thank you for growing with us. 💖</p>
            <p>We hope you love what's ahead. We're just getting started.</p>

            <br />

            <p>Thank you all a ton,</p>
