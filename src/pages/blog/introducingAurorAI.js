            <p>Update April 2, 2025: We decided using our brains is actually good... so AurorAI is gone will not be returning.</p>

            <br />

            <p>Are you tired of thinking? Do you wish you could post without actually having to come up with anything yourself? Well, say hello to <b>AurorAI</b>, Auride's revolutionary, state-of-the-art, totally-not-rushed AI-powered post generator!</p>

            <br />

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>Simple! Open the note popup, click the magic wand, click "Generate note" and AurorAI will instantly generate a post that definitely makes sense, is totally relevant to your life, and will spark deep intellectual conversations (or confusion, mostly confusion).</p>

            <br />

            <h3>What can AurorAI do?</h3>
            <p>Instantly generate <b>life-changing</b> posts like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"why do my socks keep disappearing??? is my washing machine EATING them???"</li>
                <li>"if you think about it, a burrito is just a sandwich with trust issues."</li>
                <li>i blinked and suddenly its 3am. what just happened.</li>
            </ul>


            <br />

            <h3>Why think, when you can let AI do it for you?</h3>
            <p>With AurorAI, you'll never have to worry about coming up with original thoughts again! Just press the button, post, and let the chaos unfold. Your followers will either laugh, question reality, or slowly back away from your profile.</p>

            <h3>Warning:</h3>
            <p>AurorAI is not responsible for any confusion, existential crises, or sudden loss of friends.</p>
            <p>If you begin to relate too deeply to AurorAI's posts, please seek immediate <b>real-world interactions</b>.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>But wait, there's more!</h3>
            <p>For that extra touch of randomness, every single note on Auride now has a 50% chance to flip your @username - pronouns - date, even if the post isn't AI-generated.</p>
            <p>Why? No reason. But it's happening.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Try AurorAI Today!</h3>
