        <h1>Auride is Unavailable</h1>
        <p>
            Hey all, unfortunately Auride is temporarily unavailable.
            <br />
            I really, really hope to bring Auride back before the end of December or early January 2026,
            <br />
            but with the combination of attackers, spaghetti code, bundler issues, and hosting issues,
            <br />
            Auride is completely broken and I would rather have you guys wait for a good product that can stand on its own
            <br />
            vs. something that is completely broken and can't.

            <br />
            <br />

            I sincerely apologize and I hope you all understand.
            <br />
            Soon--no more time offline, a stable Auride, and something you will all love using.
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />
