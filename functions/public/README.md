# Public API
This is TransSocial's public API. This is rate limited to 100 requests per hour (per domain) to prevent abuse, scrapping and fraud.

To increase the rate limit or get further access, please get an API key from https://dev.transs.social/protected-api (requires a TransSocial account but allows further API calls up to 5,000/hr, OAuth, and more).

The public API only has read access for publicly available information. For more information or questions, see the documentation at https://dev.transs.social/docs/public-api

For questions or information about the TransSocial API altogether, see documentation at https://dev.transs.social/docs/overview

> [!NOTE]
> Requesting increased usage limits are not available for this API.
