# Protected API
This is Auride's API. This is only available for https://auride.xyz (or if you're hosting Auride yourself, your domain).

This API has complete access to everything and will only be available for Auride itself. If you're looking for our API, please look for the "Protected" folder in "functions".

> [!CAUTION]
> This API is only permitted for use for Auride. Any other sites using this API is a security vulnerability and should be treated as such. If you find a security vulnerability related to this API, please contact @katniny on Discord to report this privately (as we prefer vulnerabilities are not public so they can be resolved without malicious users abusing it).

For questions or information about the Auride API altogether, see documentation at https://dev.auride.xyz/docs/overview
