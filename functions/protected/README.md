# Protected API
This is Auride's protected API. This is rate limited to 5,000 requests per hour (per domain).

The public API has read and write access for provided information from Auride. For more information or questions, see the documentation at https://dev.auride.xyz/docs/protected-api

> [!NOTE]
> The protected API requires manual review to ensure your site does not violate our <a href="https://auride.xyz/policies/api-terms">API Terms of Use</a>. Then, you will be provided an API key in the Auride settings, which you will be notified about in your Auride notifications.

For questions or information about the Auride API altogether, see documentation at https://dev.auride.xyz/docs/overview
