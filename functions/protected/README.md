# Protected API
This is TransSocial's protected API. This is rate limited to 5,000 requests per hour (per domain).

The public API had read and write access for provided information from TransSocial. For more information or questions, see the documentation at https://dev.transs.social/docs/protected-api

> [!NOTE]
> While anyone can register for the protected API, some operations (especially write operations) that are not already in the public API may require OAuth to get user permission. Anyone caught abusing our [API Terms of Use](https://transs.social/policies/api-terms) will be suspended from using the protected API (and possibly get your TransSocial account suspended).
